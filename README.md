R_text_mining
=============

**R project; Work in progress**

 (Part 1) Perform *text-mining* on  abstracts of science contributions, 
presented at the [AGU Fall Meeting 2012][0], San Francisco. 
This was a big annual conference for Earth scientists, in particular geophysicists and geologists.

Use R to draw interesting conclusions from a subset of the 23000 abstracts submitted. (These are *not* included with this repository.)

 (Part 2) Perform *text-mining* on  abstracts of science contributions, 
to be presented at the [EGU General Assembly 2013][1], Vienna (see below). 
This is also a big annual conference for Earth scientists, in particular geophysicists and geologists.

Both [AGU][4]  and [EGU][2]  conferences have the same target audience, and they even share the same classification system of scientific subfields.

Use R to draw interesting conclusions from a subset of the 11000 abstracts submitted. (These are also *not* included with this repository.)



[Results from this project were presented][3] at EGU General Assembly 2013, a conference in Vienna to happen in April 2013. 
There will be a poster about text-mining in R, on beginner level.

For more information about the code, read the [CONFIGURATION_AND_USAGE.md](CONFIGURATION_AND_USAGE.md) file.
To learn even more, please read the documentation in the ["doc"](doc) directory of this repo for an explanation of  *what* the scripts are doing.
